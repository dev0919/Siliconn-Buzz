Crime Awareness Database
The usage of this website is pretty simple as of now since its just a basic frontend for time being. 
On the top webpage one can see the basic information about the website. 
If you click on report crime it redirects to you to a page where you enter your phone number and send otp(currently not available).
After the authentication is complete you reach to a reporting interface where you can enter the basic details of the crime that had occured and then click submit . It then redirects to you a page where you can contact the platform through a mail id.
The check statistics button should redirect to you the maps which is color coded according to the crime statistics however the stats are still not available.
Then there is a contact us button on the top right corner which is generally in case when a user wants to get in touch. 
Yeah this is it for now .
